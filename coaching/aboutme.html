<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I have the great pleasure of working with clients to help them to create greater levels of meaning, success, and happiness
       in their lives and work. I meet with local clients in my sunny office in Montclair, NJ, and with clients from around
       the world by phone and video.<p>
  <p>My practice is grounded in Positive Psychology, a research-based branch of psychology that studies what really causes
       people to thrive in their lives and work, and how we can apply those findings in practical ways.</p>

<h3>My Career Change</h3>
  <p>I came to this work after extensive study of positive psychology theory and practice, and following a very successful
    twenty-year career as an executive with Johnson & Johnson, where I ran a $1 billion global business including brands
    such as Band-Aids, Neosporin, and Purell.</p>

<h3>My Education</h3>
  <p>I hold an MBA from the Wharton School, and a BA from the University of Delaware. I've also earned a Certificate
       in Positive Psychology and certification as a Positive Psychology Coach. And I created and teach the program
       in Positive Psychology Coach Training at the WholeBeing Institute.</p>

<h3>My Priority</h3>
  <p>Most importantly of all, I'm the very happy single mother of a wonderful daughter, whom I adopted from China
       when she was twelve months old. To my amazement, that was more than thirteen years ago. Whatever else I do in my life,
       that will always remain the best decision I ever made.</p>
