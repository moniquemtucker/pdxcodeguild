### Who Owes Who?

I wanted to turn an Excel spreadsheet I use each month into a program. 

"Who Owes Who?" reconciles finances for two people to determine who owes whom at the end of a month.

User will enter the names of the expenses, amounts, and who payed-- the program will assume an even split
and determine who owes whom.
